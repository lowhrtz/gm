Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators—when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.\nSpectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fi re or fi re based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.\nSpecial Damage: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim’s hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fi ghter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim’s strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.\nIn addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters infl icts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit  point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4 + 38 = 42.\nSpectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120 ft range. Like all trolls, the spectral troll is strong, fearless, and attacks relentlessly until it kills its opponent or is itself slain.'

In melee they prefer to wield a variety of barbed and hooked swords and battle axes or simply constrict their prey with their powerful serpentine tail.\n\nLike their fellow demons, they can cause darkness at will (5 ft radius).

If negotiation is successful, they might be persuaded to aid the summoner or associated group for a while. In any case, these demons will always try to bully and intimidate their masters in an effort to usurp leadership, which they crave.

If the master is within a mile of their quasit familiar, a constant full-sensory telepathic communication operates through the quasit. The master also gains 1 level of ability. If the quasit is within 25 feet of its master, it imparts its 25% magic resistance and also its regeneration abilities. If either master or quasit move out of range, the special abilities are lost. In addition to these abilities, once per week a quasit is able to contact the Abyss in order to help gain some necessary advice or information. This operates as the 5th level cleric spell commune, and up to 6 questions are permitted.\n\nDespite their rather low intelligence, quasits are quite crafty and cunning creatures. They are also used as tools by demon lords, who might communicate through them. Quasits are generally tasked with helping their masters to spread evil and chaos. In particular, they are often used to pervert lawful evil souls to chaos, which earns them rewards on their home plane of the Abyss. Ultimately, when its master dies, the quasit is charged with bringing the soul back to the Abyss. If the quasit has served well, it may be rewarded by being changed into a class A or class B demon. If not, they will be punished through becoming a kullule, soul worm, or even a quasit again.\n\nIf the quasit dies, the master immediately loses 4 levels (duration 1 month).'
