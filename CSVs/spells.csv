'aerial_servant','Aerial Servant','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','10''','1 day/caster level','Special','V,S','9 segments','None','Aerial Servant summons an aerial servant to do his or her bidding. The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth.\n\nWhen fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.'
'animate_dead','Animate Dead','no','cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','10''','Permanent','Special','V,S,M','1 round','None','Animate Dead calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level. '
'animate_object','Animate Object','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','6','See Description','30''','1 round/caster level','1 cubic ft/caster level','V,S','9 segments','None','Animate Object “brings to life” an inanimate object, allowing it to move and follow the cleric’s simple commands. The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.'
'astral_spell','Astral Spell','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','Touch','Special','Special','V,S','3 turns','None','Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.'
'atonement','Atonement','no','cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','1 person','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.'
'augury','Augury','no','cleric','Divination','2','N/A','Caster','Instantaneous','Caster','V,S,M','2 rounds','None','Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to  derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.'
'blade_barrier','Blade Barrier','no','cleric','Evocation','6','8d8','30''','3 rounds/caster level','Circular path 2-10 ft in radius','V,S','9 segments','None','This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).'
'bless','Bless','yes','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','1','N/A','60''','6 rounds','50 × 50 ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with—5% morale and –1 to hit.\n\nThe spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).'
'chant','Chant','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','2','N/A','0','Indefinite (duration of chant)','30 ft radius centred on caster','V,S','1 turn','None','Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.'
'command','Command','no','cleric','Enchantment/Charm','1','N/A','10''','1 round','1 living creature','V','1 segment','See Description','By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”.\n\nCreatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.'
'commune','Commune','no','cleric','Divination','5','N/A','Caster','3 rounds (limited number of questions)','See Description','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.'
'conjure_animals','Conjure Animals','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','30''','2 rounds/caster level','Conjured creatures','V,S','9 segments','None','A cleric may use this spell to conjure animal allies from thin air and order them into combat. The total hit dice of summoned animals cannot exceed the cleric’s level, and the animals must all be of the same type. This spell will only summon mammals, although giant or prehistoric forms of normal mammals may be conjured if these are present within a few miles of the caster. The GM determines the specifi c type of animal that appears.'
'continual_light','Continual Light','yes','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','120''','Permanent','60 ft radius globe','V,S','6 segments','See Description','This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost sufficient to rival the light of day. In some respects the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light , but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a light spell, extending 60 ft into the darkness. The reverse of the spell, continual darkness , produces an ink-like darkness in the same 60 ft area and negates the illumination of a continual light spell if one is present.\n\nBy casting the spell upon an enemy’s eyes or other organs of sight, the caster may blind the spell’s subject, causing the same penalties as if the creature were blinded by a light spell. In this instance, a saving throw is permitted, and if it is successful the spell’s effect will centre upon the area immediately behind the targeted creature.'
'control_weather_cleric','Control Weather','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','0','4d12 hours','4d4 square miles','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather for several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather.\n\nThis spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.'
'create_food_and_water','Create Food and Water','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','10''','Instantaneous (permanent)','A day’s ration per caster level','V,S','1 turn','None','Upon completion of the ritual words of this spell, food and/or water will appear from thin air. A caster of fi fth level can conjure up enough food and water to sustain a person or even a horse for fi ve full days. The volume of food and water produced by the spell is approximately one cubic ft per level of the caster.'
'create_water','Create Water','yes','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','1','N/A','10''','Instantaneous (permanent)','Up to 30 cubic ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water.'
'cure_blindness','Cure Blindness','yes','cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 round','None (Negate)','This powerful spell allows the cleric permanently to remove virtually all forms of blindness. The reverse of the spell permits a saving throw, and the cleric must successfully touch the spell’s intended target to inflict blindness (permanent duration).'
'cure_critical_wounds','Cure Critical Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','5','3d8+3','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','8 segments','None (Negate)','This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.'
'cure_disease','Cure Disease','yes','cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 turn','None (Negate)','By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.'
'cure_light_wounds','Cure Light Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','1','1d8','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','5 segments','None (Negate)','Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.'
'cure_serious_wounds','Cure Serious Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','4','2d8+1','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','7 segments','None (Negate)','A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.'
'detect_charm','Detect Charm','yes','cleric','Divination','2','N/A','30''','1 turn','See Description','V,S','1 round','None','This spell reveals to the cleric whether a creature is subject to a charm spell. The spell’s magic can discern a charm (or lack thereof) on up to ten creatures. The reverse of the spell conceals the existence of a charm, but affects only one creature.'
'detect_evil','Detect Evil','yes','cleric','Divination','1','N/A','Caster','1 turn + 5 rounds/caster level','Path 10 ft wide, 120 ft long','V,S,M','1 round','None','This spell allows the cleric to discern emanations of evil (or good, in the case of the spell’s reverse) within the spell’s area of effect, a beam-like pathway. The spell detects evil, not danger, so it will be useless to discover such things as a mindless trap or a poisoned wineglass. Neither will it detect a cursed item unless the nature of the curse is such that the cursed item becomes inherently evil.'
'detect_lie','Detect Lie','yes','cleric','Divination','4','N/A','30''','1 round/caster level','One person','V,S,M','7 segments','None','The subject of this spell (not necessarily the caster) gains the ability to discern whether the truth is being told, for the duration of the spell. The reverse of the spell allows the spell recipient’s most brazen falsehoods to seem logical and believable. The spell’s reverse may also be used to ward against the effects of a detect lie spell.'
'detect_magic','Detect Magic','no','cleric','Divination','1','N/A','Caster','1 turn','Path 10 ft wide, 30 ft long','V,S,M','1 round','None','Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.'
'dispel_evil','Dispel Evil','yes','cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','1 round/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','8 segments','See Description','This spell banishes summoned creatures of evil, or those summoned for evil purposes, to their home planes of existence. Although a saving throw negates the spell’s banishing effect, any creature that would otherwise have been banished will suffer a penalty of –7 to hit the caster for the extent of the spell’s duration.\n\nCreatures affected by this spell include, but are certainly not limited to, afreets, demons, devils, genies (either evil or working toward evil purposes under duress), and elementals summoned for evil purposes. The reverse of the spell has the same effects, but upon summoned creatures of good alignment or those summoned for the purposes of good.'
'dispel_magic','Dispel Magic','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','60''','Instantaneous','30 ft radius sphere','V,S','6 segments','None','Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become non-operational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility ) will be dispelled.\n\nWith respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area.'
'divination','Divination','no','cleric','Divination','4','N/A','Caster','See Description','Caster','V,S,M','1 turn','None','A divination spell gives the caster divine insight about a particular place, examples being a ruined castle, a particular region in a dungeon, or a small vale. The location of the place must be known to the cleric (e.g., the “Red Mausoleum,” if a legendary location, cannot be the focus of the spell, but if the cleric has seen the doorway of the tomb, the spell will be effective). The spell yields rich information compared to an augury , although it may be couched in rather vague and approximate terms.\n\nThe spell reveals the relative power of the creatures in the area, the treasure (“low,” “moderate,” or “rich”), and chances of incurring the wrath of gods or similar beings if the place is disturbed. There is a chance that the cleric will fail to interpret the omens properly; the base chance to succeed in gaining truthful information is 60%, and rises by another 1% per caster level. The chance may also be adjusted by the GM as necessary.\n\nIf the cleric’s reading of the omens is not correct, of course, he or she will be operating on completely false and useless “insights.” The casting of a divination spell is quite dramatic, involving the sacrifice of a dove or other such creature appropriate to the religion in question. Valuable items may also be sacrificed, and such may increase the chance of the cleric receiving clear omens that are easily interpreted.'
'earthquake','Earthquake','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','120''','1 round','5 ft diameter/caster level','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The cleric invokes a small but intensely powerful earthquake within this spell’s area of effect. The spell may be used to create landslides, drain marshes, cave in tunnels, and collapse buildings. Yawning cracks in the earth have a good chance to swallow creatures in the area: the chance of falling into such a crevice (by creature size) is 1 in 4 (small), 1 in 6 (medium) and 1 in 8 (large). Being swallowed up in such fashion is, of course, fatal. Trees standing in the area of an earthquake spell have a 1 in 3 chance of being uprooted.'
'exorcise','Exorcise','no','cleric','Abjuration','4','N/A','10''','Instantaneous (permanent)','One creature or object','V,S,M','See Description','None','Exorcism is a powerful abjuration that casts out demons, devils, or any supernatural inhabitant or influence from a creature or object that has been possessed or otherwise controlled. Exorcism banishes all charms and enchantments, removes curses, and will cast any possessing demon or other creature back into its nearest physical body other than the one being exorcised. The base chance for the cleric to perform a successful exorcism is randomly determined on a d% if the GM has not previously assigned a specific number to represent the relative difficulty of the exorcism. To the base chance is added a modifier of +1/-1 for each level of difference between the cleric’s caster level and the level or hit dice of the opposing supernatural force (determined by the GM in the case of supernatural forces with no stated level or HD). The cleric begins the exorcism, rolling a d% for each turn. If the cleric’s die roll is equal to or less than the modified chance of success, the exorcism is successful. The process cannot be halted once it has begun, and if the cleric is forced to pause before successfully casting out the supernatural force, the spell will fail.'
'feign_death','Feign Death','no','cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','Touch','1 turn + 1 round/caster level','One willing creature','V,S,M','2 segments','None','Except as described here, this spell is identical to the third level magic user spell of the same name. The clerical version of the spell is not subject to a limit on the character level it can affect. Note that the spell cannot be cast upon an unwilling subject.'
'find_the_path','Find the Path','yes','cleric','Divination','6','N/A','Touch','1 turn/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','3 rounds','None','This spell imbues one creature with an uncanny sense for the shortest route into or out of a chosen locale. The spell imparts only a visceral intuition of the right direction and shortest distance, so it is impossible to use the spell either to circumvent dangers or to draw a map. This spell may be used to escape from a maze spell (q.v.) in one round and will continue to function thereafter. The spell’s reverse makes a creature unable to make any significant movement beyond aimless wandering.'
'find_traps','Find Traps','no','cleric','Divination','2','N/A','30''','3 turns','10 ft wide path','V,S','5 segments','None','This spell permits the cleric to discern the existence of traps, both of magical and mechanical nature. The cleric must be looking at a trap in order to perceive it.'
'flame_strike','Flame Strike','no','cleric','Evocation','5','6d8','60''','1 segment','10 ft diameter column, 30 ft high','V,S,M','8 segments','Half','Upon the casting of this spell, a blazing column of fire descends from the air. Its searing flames engulf an area 10 ft in diameter, as set by the caster. Each creature caught within the flames will suffer 6d8 points of damage, halved if the creature makes a successful saving throw.'
'gate','Gate','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','7','N/A','30''','See Description','One summoned creature','V,S','5 segments','None','A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and irascible.'
'glyph_of_warding','Glyph of Warding','no','cleric','Abjuration/Evocation','3','See Description','Touch','Permanent (until discharged)','25 square ft/caster level','V,S,M','See Description','See Description','The glyph of warding is a magically charged sigil or rune, scribed and enchanted to serve as the focal point of a powerful magical trap. The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, floor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defining what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics. The GM must determine what glyphs may be within the capabilities of such formidable individuals.'
'heal','Heal','no','cleric','Necromancy','6','See Description','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 round','None (Negate)','This spell affects the same general variety of creatures as the cure light wounds spell (q.v.), but it is necromancy on an entirely different level than the various cure spells. Heal removes all hit point damage with the exception of the last 1d4 points, removes blindness, cures disease, and will negates the effects of a feeblemind spell. The reverse, harm, causes damage sufficient to reduce the target to 1d4 remaining hit points, and also causes disease.'
'hold_person','Hold Person','no','cleric','Enchantment/Charm','2','N/A','60''','4 rounds + 1 round/caster level','1-3 creatures','V,S,M','5 segments','Negate','A hold person spell completely immobilises up to three medium-sized or smaller persons for the spell’s duration. The cleric decides how many of his or her foes he or she will target with the spell. If there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –2; if two, each makes the saving throw at –1; and if the cleric seeks to hold three enemies, each makes its saving throw with no penalty. If a magic item or spell operates partially to negate the effects of paralysis, failing the save will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. Creatures affected by this spell include humans, demi-humans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. Persons held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.'
'holy_word','Holy Word','yes','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','7','N/A','0','See Description','30 ft radius','V','1 segment','None','Holy word is a spell of intrinsically good alignment. The intonation of a holy word utterly banishes evil creatures not native to the caster’s plane, hurling them back to their respective planes of existence. Additionally, creatures not of good alignment (including those evil creatures which are native to the caster’s plane, as well as neutral creatures not of good alignment) will suffer effects from the holy word in accordance with the creature’s hit dice:\nLess than 4 HD : Kills\n4-7 HD : Paralyses (duration 10-40 rounds)\n8-11 HD : Stuns, reduces move by 50%, causes –4 to attack rolls (duration 2-8 rounds)\n12+ HD : Deafens, reduces move by 25%, causes –2 to attack rolls, causes 50% chance of spell failure (duration 1- 4 rounds)\n\nThe spell’s reverse is unholy word, which functions in the same manner as holy word but against creatures of good alignment rather than evil.

'insect_plague','Insect Plague','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','5','See Description','360''','1 turn/caster level','Cloud of 180 ft radius, 60 ft high','V,S,M','1 turn','None','While casting this spell, the cleric designates a central point for the spell’s origin up to 360 ft from where he or she stands. When the cleric utters the final words of the incantation, this focal point belches forth a massive cloud of stinging insects, which boils outward almost instantly to fill the spell’s area of effect. Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force , etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point. Even a fireball or flame strike will do nothing other than temporarily (1 turn) to clear the insects out of the area affected by their flames.'

The auras of up to ten creatures may be examined by use of the spell, and the cleric will be able to identify the exact alignment of each. The reverse of the spell obscures alignment (even against the use of this spell) with respect to one creature for a period of 1 turn, two people for a period of 5 rounds, and so on.'

The caster may extinguish the magical light at any time. The reverse of the spell, darkness , creates an area of utter darkness just as the light spell creates light, with the only distinction being that the darkness spell has half the duration of a light spell. If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense. The light spell remains stationary if it was not originally cast upon a movable object or creature (in which case the target will bring the illumination with it as it moves).'

It is not necessary for the caster to have seen the precise object that the spell will locate: if the caster is familiar with ladders in general, he or she may cast the spell successfully to locate any ladder within the spell’s range. The spell is directional, requiring the cleric to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The cleric may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.) The reverse of the spell may be used to obscure one object from magical detection of virtually all kinds (including such means as a crystal ball as well as divination spells).'
'lower_water','Lower Water','yes','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','4','N/A','120''','1 turn/caster level','See Description','V,S,M','1 turn','None','With a majestic gesture, the cleric forces an area of water to sink downward by 5% of its original depth per caster level. Despite its name, the spell’s power is not limited to water; it can affect other non-living fl uid substances as well, including gases and materials slightly more viscous than water. The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the cleric. For example, a cleric of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 x 70 ft. The reverse of the spell raises water in an area of effect similar to that of lower water , but not to the same degree of height, returning water to its natural level plus one foot per caster level.'

An opponent (a venomous spider, for example) must be successfully touched by the cleric, but is not entitled to a saving throw if the attack succeeds. Note that if the venomous creature produces new venom (normally a process that takes time), the new venom will be toxic, but any venom that is stored up in the creature will be affected and detoxified. The spell may also be used to prevent a poisoned character from suffering the poison’s effects. The reverse of the spell allows the cleric to deliver a lethally poisonous touch, requiring a successful roll to hit, and allowing a saving throw against the poison.'

The depth and length of the water displacement is determined by the cleric’s level. For each caster level, the cleric may displace an area of water 30 ft deep and 20 ft wide. The spell can affect other liquids besides water, but the more different the physical properties of the other liquid, the less the cleric may be capable of displacing.'

All persons to make the journey must link hands in a circle, and when the cleric finishes the spell and completes the circle, the caster and his or her companions will be drawn beyond the boundaries of the material plane and into the supernatural regions beyond, the home realms of gods, demons, and elementals. An unwilling victim must be touched by the cleric in order for the cleric to send him or her to another plane, and a saving throw is also applicable. The casting of a plane shift spell provides one-way travel to the other plane; a second casting of the spell (or a similar spell of planar travel) is required in order to make the return journey. The cleric must possess a metal tuning fork attuned specifically to the plane of destination in order to cast the spell.'

Note that the cleric is able to move and take other actions while the prayer spell is in effect, which is not the case with the more restricted chant spell.'
'protection_from_evil','Protection from Evil','yes','cleric','Abjuration','1','N/A','Touch','3 rounds/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','4 segments','None','This spell surrounds the recipient with an invisible aura of divine protection, emanating from the recipient to a distance of one foot. The aura is not invulnerable, but it affords considerable protection against evil and summoned creatures, much as a powerful magic circle would. The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extra-planar creatures regardless of alignment. To cast either form of the spell, the caster speaks the ritual words of the spell while describing a circle around the being to be warded, using holy water or incense (blood or smouldering dung for the reverse of the spell).'

If the enchanted creature does not properly follow the letter and spirit of the quest, it will suffer a cumulative penalty of –1 to all saving throw rolls for each day the quest is neglected. This penalty, which is itself in the nature of a curse, remains with the creature until the quest is completed or the curse is removed by the caster or by some other agency. Possible objectives for a quest are legion; they might include finding and bringing some valuable item to the cleric, capturing a castle, slaying a monster, or any number of other tasks.'
'raise_dead','Raise Dead','yes','cleric','Necromancy','5','See Description','30''','Instantaneous (permanent)','One person','V,S','1 round','See Description','The eerie, keening incantation of this spell calls a soul back from the afterlife, literally bringing the dead back to life. Elves, as they do not have souls, cannot be brought back to life in this manner, but humans, half-elves, half-orcs, gnomes, dwarfs, and halflings can all be raised from the dead by means of this spell. The longer a soul has been departed from the material plane, the more difficult it is to call it back; a cleric can summon back a soul that has been dead no more days than the cleric’s level. In other words, a cleric of tenth level can raise a person who has been dead no more than ten days, but an eleventh level cleric can raise a person who has been dead eleven days. The raised person must survive a system shock saving throw in order to return to life, and he or she will be unable to engage in strenuous activity (such as combat, study, or spell casting) for a period of time equal to one day for each day that he or she was dead.\n\nPerhaps mercifully, the spell erases the returning character’s memory concerning any places his or her soul may have visited following death.\n\nRaise dead can instantly destroy most kinds of corporeal undead creatures (exception: it does not destroy liches). Incorporeal undead, such as ghosts or spectres, are immune. This use is treated the same as the reverse of the spell in terms of saving throws and damage.\n\nThe reverse of the spell is referred to in hushed tones as slay living . The subject of this spell (which must be used with extreme caution by good clerics, lest their alignment be altered) is entitled to a saving throw, and if the throw fails, the subject dies. If the saving throw succeeds, the target will still sustain 2d8+1 points of damage.'
'regenerate','Regenerate','yes','cleric','Necromancy','7','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous','One creature','V,S,M','3 rounds','None','The powerful regeneration spell causes severed body parts to reattach themselves in a single round, or to regrow within 2-8 turns. The spell’s reverse causes a touched appendage to wither and fall away to dust within 2-8 turns.

'remove_curse','Remove Curse','yes','cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous','See Description','V,S','6 segments','See Description','This spell allows the cleric to remove curses from persons and objects, and the spell can have a variety of other applications against evil manifestations. Magical items imbued with curses cannot be destroyed by the spell’s power, but use of the spell upon a person under the influence of such an item will generally free the person from the curse and allow him or her to be rid of the item.\n\nThe spell’s reverse, bestow curse, inflicts the subject with a magical curse, the exact nature of which is not entirely within the caster’s control:\nReduce one ability score to 3:50%\nCause –4 penalty to hit and on saving throws:25%\nCause victim (50% chance per turn) to drop any objects it is holding (or in the case of an non-toolusing creature, not act for one round):25%\n\nWith the GM’s agreement, the character may design a specific curse to use with this spell other than the random curse the spell normally unleashes. In order to bestow a curse, the cleric must successfully touch the intended victim, who is entitled to a saving throw. The duration of a bestowed curse is 1 turn/caster level.'
'remove_fear','Remove Fear','yes','cleric','Abjuration','1','N/A','Touch','See Description','Creature touched','V,S','4 segments','None','This spell is a divine warding against fear, and it can also banish magical terror in someone already affected. In the latter case, the spell grants a second saving throw at a bonus of +1 per caster level.

'resist_cold','Resist Cold','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','1','N/A','Touch','1 turn/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','1 round','None','By touching the spell’s intended recipient and casting the spell, the cleric instills the recipient with a supernatural resistance to the effects of extreme cold. Normal cold, temperatures ranging down to zero degrees Fahrenheit, is perceived as normal temperature. The subject also gains a saving throw bonus of +3 against magical cold, taking one half damage if the save is not successful and one quarter damage if the save is successful. The saving throw is permitted even against attacks that would not ordinarily permit a saving throw (such as a magically cold sword).'

A person under the influence of this spell can stand unharmed in the middle of a bonfire, and even gains a measure of resistance to magical fire. The subject gains a saving throw bonus of +3 against magical fire, taking one half damage if the save is not successful and one quarter damage if the save is successful. The saving throw is permitted even against attacks that would not ordinarily allow a saving throw.'
'restoration','Restoration','yes','cleric','Necromancy','7','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','One creature','V,S','3 rounds','None','By casting this spell, the cleric restores one lost level of experience to the spell’s target. Not necessarily all lost experience points are restored; an afflicted character will only regain enough experience points to regain the lost level, no more. A cleric can only restore a level lost within as many days as the cleric’s caster level. For example, a cleric of 12th level cannot restore an experience level lost 13 or more days prior to the casting of the spell. The spell’s reverse causes the target to lose one experience level. No saving throw applies, but a successful attack is required. In addition to restoring lost levels, the spell can affect other sorts of magically-induced debilities. The effects of a feeblemind spell are reversed by restoration, for example.'
'resurrection','Resurrection','yes','cleric','Necromancy','7','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','One person','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The awesome power of a resurrection spell brings the dead back to life. Unlike raise dead , a resurrection spell may be cast upon a person who has been dead for as many as 10 years per caster level. Casting the spell requires the cleric to rest for one day per level of the person raised. Elves cannot be resurrected, having no souls, but humans and the rest of their ilk (half-elves, dwarfs, etc.) can be affected. As with raise dead, the recipient’s memory of whatever transpired between death and resurrection is erased.\n\nThe reverse of the spell kills the subject and turns him or her to dust, requiring a successful attack roll to touch.'

In order for any foe to attack the caster of the spell, the enemy must make a successful saving throw against magic. Failing the saving throw permits the enemy to attack another target, but the cleric will be completely ignored. The spell does not prevent an enemy from including the cleric within the area of effect of a hostile spell, provided that the cleric is not the intended target. The cleric may not undertake any hostile actions while protected by a sanctuary , or the spell’s power will be dissipated and end. However, the cleric may cast spells and otherwise act in ways that are not directly hostile, such as curing wounds, casting a spell such as bless, or even stealing an item if faith and alignment permit.'

The spell may be cast upon a location in the air, upon a physical object (in which case it will move with the object), or upon a creature (in which case a saving throw is applicable). If the creature makes a saving throw, the area of silence will centre upon the space just behind the intended victim.'
'slow_poison','Slow Poison','no','cleric','Necromancy','2','N/A','Touch','2 rounds/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','1 segment','None','This spell is used to slow the progress of poison through the body. Even a person who has died from poison may be revived if he succumbed to the poison within a number of turns less than or equal to the caster’s level of experience. The spell does not eliminate or neutralise poison; it merely slows it. A poisoned creature will lose 1 hit point per turn (but will not fall below 1) during the spell’s duration; once the spell’s protection expires, the victim will suffer the full potency of the poison. The spell is generally used to keep someone alive until the poison can be neutralised completely by other means, such as a neutralise poison spell.'
'snake_charm','Snake Charm','no','cleric','Enchantment/Charm','2','N/A','30''','See Description','See Description','V,S','5 segments','None','A pattern of gestures made by the cleric in the course of casting this spell creates a hypnotic effect on snakes. Any snake affected by the spell will rise up and begin swaying back and forth, otherwise remaining motionless. A cleric can affect multiple serpents with the spell, up to a total number of hit points equal to the cleric’s own. The spell’s duration depends upon the existing emotions of the snake at the time the spell is cast. If the snake was asleep, the duration of the charm is 1d4+2 turns; if the snake was awake but not angry, the duration will be 1-3 turns; and if the snake was angry (or attacking), the spell will last 1d4+4 rounds.'

While the spell lasts, the animal (and any other animals of the same type in its company) will refrain from attacking, even if they were initially hostile. Depending upon the nature of the conversation, if the animal’s alignment is neutral or of the same tendency as the cleric’s, the animal may be disposed to help the cleric in some manner. It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power. Neither does the spell suddenly imbue an animal with intelligence; the observations and opinions of an animal such as a badger will be appropriate to the animal’s own experiences, motives, and intellectual limitations.'

The real hammer disappears, replaced with a mist-like shape of divine force that attacks at the cleric’s will while the cleric concentrates upon maintaining it (limited, of course, to the duration of the spell). The hammer strikes as a magical weapon for purposes of affecting creatures hit only by magic weapons (as if it were a +1 weapon, with an additional +1 per three levels of the caster), but it has no actual bonus on to hit rolls. The spiritual weapon attacks as if it were wielded by the cleric, at the cleric’s level and with any appropriate to hit and damage bonuses (or penalties). The weapon does damage as a normal war hammer.'

The spell transforms one stick per caster level, and each snake has a 5% chance per caster level of being venomous. The reverse of the spell will change snakes into harmless sticks and can work such a transformation upon snakes created by means of this spell.

Any creature seeing the symbol closely enough to discern its shape (approximately 100 ft) will be affected by it. The clerical casting of this spell allows for three different symbols:\nHopelessness, Pain, and Persuasion.\n\nHopelessness: The symbol of hopelessness causes despair. Any creature (other than those with no intelligence) failing the saving throw will wander sadly away or surrender in the face of a challenge such as a combat. The despair will persist for 3d4 turns.\n\nPain: The symbol of pain inflicts terrible, shooting pains for a duration of 2-20 turns. Any creature so affected will suffer a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a temporary loss of 2 dexterity points.\n\nPersuasion: Those viewing the symbol of persuasion and failing their saving throw will undergo a temporary change of alignment to the caster’s alignment and become friendly to the caster for 1d20 turns.'

Alignment auras become visible so that the cleric can discern good from evil, law from chaos. Polymorphed items and creatures are seen in their true shape.

Transportation by means of word of recall is instantaneous and not subject to error. The sanctuary may be of any distance from the cleric, and may be above or below ground.

Once the spell is complete, the animal will remain with the druid and can learn tricks similar to those that could be taught to a well-trained domestic pet. Each trick takes a week to learn, and after the animal has been with the druid for three months it will no longer be able to learn new tricks. During this period, if the animal is left alone by the druid for more than three days, the enchantment will be broken and the animal will revert to the wild.

If the target creature fails a saving throw, it will view the druid as a trusted friend, interpreting his or her every word in its most positive light. Charmed creatures will place themselves into moderate danger, including combat, on the druid’s behalf, but will not undertake risks beyond those the creature might ordinarily take.

Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell, but druids are able to cause more of a change than clerics can with the same spell; effectively twice the amount of change is possible for a druid. The druid could not bring heavy rain forth on a clear day, but could change the weather from clear to partly cloudy, and then to fully cloudy (with light rain, perhaps), all in the course of one casting. By comparison, a cleric would only have been able to bring about partial clouds. Hot weather can be made cool, and a strong wind can be raised from calm air.

The swarm is composed of (1d6+4) ×100 non-flying vermin, each of which inflicts 1 hp damage against an opponent before dying. Only as many insects as are needed to kill an opponent will die, and once the target is dead the swarm will move on. If the druid allows the swarm to get more than 80 ft away from his or her person, 50 insects for every 10 ft beyond this range will depart the swarm. The druid can order the swarm to attack specific targets and/or to change direction.

If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength.

Transformed acorns may be used as missiles, and transformed holly berries as delayed-action bombs. The spell allows the druid to create four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds, or a proportionate combination such as two acorns and four holly berries. Acorns may be thrown at a range of up to 40 ft and cause 2d8 points of damage in a radius of 5 ft, igniting any combustibles that fail item saving throws. If an acorn strikes its target with a successful to-hit roll, the target is not entitled to a saving throw. Even if the attack misses, the target may be caught in the blast area (and would be entitled to a saving throw for half damage, as any other creature within the blast area). The holly berries may be thrown no more than 6 ft, or may be left in place to ignite upon a command word. (The range of the command word is 40 ft.) Holly berries create an explosion in an area of 5 × 5 ft, inflicting 1d8 points of damage and causing combustible items to make saving throws against magical fire or burn.

A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion.

Woodland fey and other druids will immediately discern the forest’s illusory nature, but even normal animals will be fooled by the forest’s appearance. The illusion is not tactile, only visual, so it is likely that intelligent beings entering the forest will quickly realize they are walking in an illusion. However, the mere realization that the forest is not real does not dispel the illusion, and it will continue to limit vision and possibly create other inconveniences; horses, for example, will not walk a straight path through the illusion, circling around the “trees” they perceive as real.'

In the case of moulds, fungi, and other plants that cannot be considered separately, the spell affects 4-16 square yards of space, as decided by the druid. In the case of plant creatures such as treants, the spell affects between one and four creatures, at the caster’s option.\n\nDepending upon how many creatures (or sq yards of space) the druid targets, the saving throw against the spell is subject to different penalties. If one creature (4 sq yards) is targeted, the saving throw against the spell is made at a penalty of –4; two creatures or 8 sq yards suffer a penalty of –2; three creatures or 12 sq yards suffer a penalty of –1; and four creatures or 16 sq yards suffer no penalty on the saving throw.'

Within the area of this massive cloud, visibility is limited to 30 ft, and all creatures automatically sustain 1 hit point of damage per round from the stings and bites of the numberless flying vermin. All creatures caught in the cloud with 4 or fewer hit dice must check morale, and those with 2 or fewer hit dice will automatically flee until they are 240 ft away from the edge of the roiling cloud. Fire and smoke will keep the swarm at bay (as will walls of force , etc.), but virtually the only way to disperse a swarm before the spell duration expires is to cast dispel magic upon the swarm’s focal point.

Note that if the venomous creature produces new venom (normally a process that takes time), the new venom will be toxic, but any venom that is stored up in the creature will be affected and detoxified. The spell may also be used to prevent a poisoned character from suffering the poison’s effects. The reverse of the spell allows the druid to deliver a lethally poisonous touch, requiring a successful roll to hit, and allowing a saving throw against the poison.'

The druid determines the direction in which he or she will travel from one tree to another. Most trees permit a maximum distance of travel of 300 yards, but trees sacred to druids allow travel of considerably greater distance; oak, yew, and rowan trees permit the druid to travel as far as 600 yards. If no tree of the same type is to be found in the direction the druid designates, he or she will emerge from any tree of that species within the spell’s range closest to the direction he or she specified. The druid may remain in the first tree for as long as one round per caster level before being forced to leave the other tree, and in this case he or she will be treated in the same way as for a plant door spell. If no appropriate tree is available for the druid to step from, he or she may remain in the first tree for the spell’s duration, but will not be able to use the spell for travelling.'

Any damage incurred by fire attacks will also reduced by half.

Both possible uses of the spell require an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell’s range), and the spell’s area of effect depends on the size of the originating fire.\n\nIf the spell is used to produce fireworks, the flashing display will temporarily blind (for 1d4+1 rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond—provided that the display is not obstructed from view, of course. The fireworks fill an area ten times the volume of the original fire source and persist for 1 segment/caster level.\n\nIf the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft in an area 100 times the volume of the fire source.

The spell is cast upon a rope, vine, or cord, which then blends perfectly with the surroundings, becoming 90% undetectable to normal (unenchanted) vision. When any creature steps into the area bounded by the snare, the snare will whip closed and bind the victim tightly. Strength of 23 is required to break the snare for one hour after the spell is triggered, and the strength required falls by one point per hour until 12 hours have elapsed, at which time the spell ceases to have any effect. If the snare is attached to a suitably flexible tree, the spell will magically bend the tree so that when the trap is triggered it will snap the victim into the air for 1d6 points of damage and hold it suspended from the branches.'

When the caster invokes this spell, he or she becomes able to communicate with and understand the “speech” of normal animals (with the exception of mindless creatures). While the spell lasts, the animal (and any other animals of the same type in its company) will refrain from attacking, even if they were initially hostile. Depending upon the nature of the conversation, if the animal’s alignment is neutral or of the same tendency as the druid’s, the animal may be disposed to help the druid in some manner. It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power. Neither does the spell suddenly imbue an animal with intelligence; the observations and opinions of an animal such as a badger will be appropriate to the animal’s own experiences, motives, and intellectual limitations.'

He or she may pose questions and understand the answers given, although any conclusions or opinions the plant provides will be based on the plant’s level of intelligence. Even a normal plant, however, will be able to convey information about events that have transpired near it. If the plants are capable of motion, it will be possible for the druid to persuade them into a course of action, such as drawing aside to allow passage, or even attacking an enemy citadel.'

The snakes may be ordered to take other actions if the druid can speak with them, but this spell alone does not grant the power to communicate with the snakes, only to will them to attack particular opponents. The spell transforms one stick per caster level, and each snake has a 5% chance per caster level of being venomous. The reverse of the spell will change snakes into harmless sticks and can work such a transformation upon snakes created by means of this spell. Sticks of a magical quality, such as wands or magic spears, are not affected by the spell.'

There is a 70% chance that the swarm will be composed of flying insects, 30% chance that the insects will be ants or other non-airborne biting vermin. A flying swarm can move tremendously fast, but a crawling swarm is limited to movement of 12 ft/ round. In either case, the insects automatically inflict 2 hp damage per round against their target, and the unfortunate victim will be so thickly covered as to be incapable of any action, including movement. The druid may redirect the swarm to attack another opponent, but the command will cause 1 round of confusion within the swarm as it reorients itself toward the new target.'

'transmute_rock_to_mud','Transmute Rock to Mud','yes','druid','Transmutation/Alteration','5','N/A','160’','See Description','20 ft cube/caster level','V,S,M','7 segments','None','This spell transforms solid rock into mud, the volume transformed being proportionate to the caster’s level. Any volume of mud will sink until its depth is equal to about one half the pool’s diameter. If this spell is cast upon a ceiling, the resulting volume of mud will immediately collapse, possibly trapping or suffocating those caught beneath. Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed). The spell’s reverse transforms mud into sandstone or a similar sedimentary rock.'
'transport_via_plants','Transport via Plants','no','druid','Transmutation/Alteration','6','N/A','Touch','See Description','See Description','V,S','3 segments','None','The mystic oneness of all nature is a principal tenet of many druidic sects, and it sees practical use in the transport via plants spell. Upon casting this spell, the druid may travel almost instantly from one plant to another through the mystic oneness that joins all life forms. The spell operates in much the same fashion as pass plant, but with an unlimited range.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the druid simply steps into a large plant of any kind and disappears into it. He or she may remain in the first plant for up to 24 hours, but at any time he or she may step forth from another plant of the same species in another location. The druid may know of a specific plant from which he or she wants to emerge, or may simply specify a distance and a direction. If the druid does not know of a specific destination plant, his or her arrival may be off by 1d% miles from the desired point of arrival, at the GM’s discretion.'

The spell is neither an illusion nor a charm: the druid is, for all intents and purposes, a tree. However, in tree shape the druid retains human senses and will be fully aware of his or her surroundings. The druid may shift back into human shape at will, thereby ending the spell. Magical detections will reveal the druid’s true form, but ordinary inspections, no matter how minute, will not.'
'trip','Trip','no','druid','Enchantment/Charm','2','See Description','Touch','1 turn/caster level','One object, up to 10 ft length','V,S,M','4 segments','Negate','This spell turns an appropriate object into a magical trap of sorts. The object rises from the ground and trips any creature crossing over it, even if they are aware of it (saving throw vs spells—unlisted category, +4 if aware of the object). The object is 80% undetectable and will affect even the caster. The trap causes falls to be much worse than normal: a running creature will suffer 1d6 points of damage and be stunned for 1d4+1 rounds, or will merely be stunned if they fall onto a soft surface such as grass. Creatures larger than size M are not affected by the spell.'

Even very large wooden structures that are not affixed to the ground will be affected, although objects fixed to the ground will manage to withstand the spell’s awesome power. A sapling-sized or smaller piece of wood will splinter and break even if it is firmly affixed. The druid need not concentrate on maintaining the waves of force and cannot change the direction of the flow of eldritch power once it is set.'
'wall_of_fire','Wall of Fire','no','druid','Evocation','5','See Description','80 ft (wall) or caster (ring)','See Description','See Description','V,S,M','7 segments','None','One of the more dramatic examples of druidic magic is the wall of fire spell, by which the druid calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the shape of a wall. One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict. The wall persists for as long as the druid concentrates upon it, or, if the druid does not choose to maintain concentration, will remain for 1 round/ caster level. The druid may evoke a wall of fire in one of two shapes: a wall or a ring. The size of a straight wall is up to one 20 ft square per caster level. A ring has a radius of up to five ft per caster level (with the caster in the centre) and is 20 ft high. If the druid manifests the spell as a wall, the effect is stationary. The ring-shaped wall moves with the caster.'
'wall_of_thorns','Wall of Thorns','no','druid','Conjuration/Summoning','6','See Description','80’','1 turn/caster level','100 ft cube/caster level','V,S','8 segments','None','When the druid casts this spell, a tangled wall of briar vines erupts from the ground, bristling with sharp, deadly thorns. Running into or attempting to force a way through the thorns will cause 8 hp damage, plus 1 hp for every point of armour class. A creature may be caught within the wall of thorns when the spell is cast, and if this is the case it will take damage immediately and must fight through (taking damage a second time) to gain enough freedom of motion to chop at the thorns. It takes four turns to cut through a 40 ft thickness of a wall of thorns.\n\nNormal fire has no effect upon a wall of thorns, but magical fire can ignite the entire growth, creating a wall of fire (as per the spell) that burns away to nothing in two turns.'
'warp_wood','Warp Wood','no','druid','Transmutation/Alteration','2','N/A','10’/caster level','Instantaneous (permanent)','See Description','V,S,M','4 segments','None','This spell permanently warps wood and may be used to destroy arrows, spears, doors, etc. The druid may affect a volume of wood roughly fifteen inches long by one inch thick per caster level, about the volume of an axe handle. Multiple items may be affected; four arrows have about the same volume as an axe handle. A fifth-level druid could effectively destroy a normal door with this spell.'

It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather.\n\nThis spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.'

Any fire within the spell’s size limitations may be made as small as a candle flame or turned into a bonfire up to 3 ft in diameter. An affected fire only consumes fuel appropriate to its new size, but will continue to radiate the same heat as a fire of its original size.'

The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good magic users unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A magic user may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level. '

Spell effects do not enter or function within the shell, providing the caster with complete protection from gaze attacks, hostile spells, and even the entrance of conjured or summoned creatures into his or her vicinity. The drawback of an anti-magic shell, of course, is that the caster him- or herself cannot cast spells or avail him- or herself of magic items while inside. Magic weapons, armour, and the like do not gain their bonuses or abilities while inside the shell, but would still function as non-magical weapons or armour.'

Either a race of creature or an alignment must be specified. Note that if the spell is cast upon an object rather than an area, the targeted type of creature will have a penalty of –2 on the saving throw. If the magic user creates an antipathy for the area or object, the targeted creature type will feel an intense desire to stay away from it. A saving throw applies, permitting the creature to remain, or to touch the object, but even if the saving throw is successful the creature will feel extremely uncomfortable in its presence. Creatures that are able to remain in the area or near the object will begin to lose 1 point of dexterity per round (maximum 4 points) from discomfort.\n\nIf the magic user creates sympathy for an object or area, on the other hand, the targeted creature type will feel attracted to the area or object, pleased to remain in the vicinity, or covetous of the “precious” item. If the creature does not make a saving throw, it will do whatever is in its power to stay in contact with the area or the enchanted object.'
'astral_spell_arcane','Astral Spell','no','magic_user','Evocation','9','N/A','Touch','See Description','See Description','V,S','9 segments','None','Casting an astral spell allows the magic user and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the magic user may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

The caster designates a focal point for the spell, which must, of course, be within the spell’s range. The focal point can be moved by the caster at will until the spell’s duration expires. The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster’s level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds. Players must state such disbelief, while the GM will make such determinations for monsters and NPCs based on the plausibility of the audible glamour.'
'blink','Blink','no','magic_user','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','Caster','1 round/caster level','Caster','V,S','1 segment','None','This spell is a weak and rather unreliable form of one of the true mage’s most powerful capabilities: teleportation magic. For the duration of the spell, the magic user teleports 2 ft in a random direction once per round. The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10 ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence. During and after the segment in which the teleportation occurs, the magic user’s sudden change of location prevents any direct attacks upon him or her. The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area of effect spell, he will suffer its effects. The constant changes of location take a toll upon the caster, who has a 25% chance of failing at attempts to cast spells, use most magic items, or take any action beyond making physical attacks.'

In order to cast the spell, the caster must know the fiend’s true name, but such information is often contained in forbidden tomes of lost lore. The spell cannot summon the lesser sorts of demons that have no personal names, nor is it powerful enough to summon members of the demonic or diabolical nobility. The spell provides no protection whatsoever against the wrath of the summoned creature—and make no mistake, the summoned creature will be extremely resentful of the caster’s temerity.\n\nIn general, this spell is cast only with multiple protections against the summoned fiend, such as a pentacle to contain the demon and a magic circle to protect the magic user. The exact nature of any discussions or negotiations with creatures of the nether planes is, of course, a matter to be handled in the course of the game, with the GM deciding what the fiend is thinking and how it acts.\n\nIt is treacherous in the extreme to deal with demons, for they are intelligent and ruthless. They are not, however, unreliable; since the caster knows the fiend’s true name, it is compelled to abide by any agreements it might make, although it might be able to twist the spirit of the agreement while still abiding to the letter of it.\n\nCertain spells (spirit-rack or trap the soul, for example) can be (and often are) used to strengthen the magic user’s hand in any negotiations with a demon.'

The magic user exerts control over the elemental by concentrating upon it, and if his or her concentration is broken by being damaged or grabbed, he or she will lose control of the elemental.

The volume of a 20 ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic ft, and there are 1,000 cubic ft in a 10 × 10 × 10 ft area, so in an area with a 10 ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10 × 10 ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions.

The area does radiate magic, slightly, and the reality will be perceived by true seeing (although the travel time will still be altered even for those who know that the distance is distorted). Otherwise, the spell is utterly undetectable.'

He or she can fit through the thinnest of spaces provided they are large enough to accommodate his or her remaining two dimensions—he or she cannot bend down while two-dimensional. Moreover, he or she can become invisible by the simple expedient of turning sideways. While two-dimensional, the caster can move, cast spells, and otherwise act normally. If attacked from the front or back, however, he or she takes three times normal damage. Casting the spell requires expensive material components of (1d4+4)×1,000 gp in value. '
'enchant_an_item','Enchant an Item','no','magic_user','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','Touch','See Description','One Item','V,S,M','1d8+2 days','See Description','This spell is the culminating moment involved in the creation of a true magic item, when the item is actually infused with the magic properties it has been painstakingly prepared to hold. Before the spell can actually be cast, the magic user must engage in considerable time-consuming and meticulous work, or the spell will certainly fail.\n\nFirstly, the item itself must be of absolutely the finest quality available, in terms of craftsmanship, although it need not necessarily be fancy. In most cases, special components such as powders or threads will be incorporated into the item’s construction, costing not less than 100 gp. The casting of the spell takes 1d8+2 days, with the caster work ing steadily upon the item for eight hours per day. No other spells may be cast during this period of time, nor can the magic user engage in any other meaningful work. When the final words of the spell are spoken, the item makes a saving throw against spells at the same level as the magic user, but with success on the saving throw indicating that the spell has succeeded. A natural result of 1 on this roll always indicates failure of the spell. At this point, the magic user may begin to infuse the item with enchantments, each of which requires 5d8 hours to complete. Most magic items will require unusual components; dragon scales or blood for a sword with an unusually high bonus against dragons, for example. The GM will determine exactly what is required for any particular magic item.\n\nThis spell is not permanent unless a permanency spell is cast upon it; the duration of the enchantment may be for a year or more without a permanency spell, but the enchantment will eventually fail if it is not locked in to the item.'

The magic user’s power limits the volume of material that he or she can enlarge; the mage can affect no more than 10 cubic ft of living matter, or 5 cubic ft of non-living matter, per level. A normal sized person doubled in size will generally have strength of 18, and tripled in size would have strength of 20+. The spell’s reverse applies in the same ratios, but with the effect of reducing the size of an object or creature. If the spell is cast on an unwilling recipient, a successful saving throw will negate the spell, but willing recipients may choose to forgo the save.'

The reader of the runes does not receive a saving throw. The caster and any other magic user with whom the caster has made familiar the secret pattern of the runes can read the protected document or tome without danger, and the caster can erase them at will. Otherwise, only a dispel magic or similar enchantment will remove the runes before they are triggered.\n\nNote that the item upon which the runes are scribed, if it is not resistant to fire, will undoubtedly be destroyed when the runes detonate.'

Furthermore, if a thief attempts to remove the illusory trap, believing it to be real, there is only a 20% likelihood that the illusion will be dispelled or exposed by these efforts. In this case, the thief, seeing the illusion unchanged, will usually conclude that the attempt to remove the “trap” has failed.

The magic user can affect a weight of up to 200 lbs plus another 200 lbs/ caster level.

The different types of spell casting ability are not equally vulnerable to the feeblemind spell. Practitioners of clerical magic gain a bonus of +1 to saving throws; druids save at –1; magic users and illusionists save at –4.

Damage caused to the pseudo-corpse is reduced by one half, and the spell’s recipient will not even know that the damage has been caused—potentially a dangerous situation. A person under the influence of this spell is not subject to level draining by the undead and will not be affected by poisons until the spell wears off or is otherwise removed; the caster can remove the catalepsy at will, and the spell is subject to being dispelled.'
'find_familiar','Find Familiar','no','magic_user','Conjuration/Summoning','1','N/A','0','See Description','1 mile radius/caster level','V,S,M','2d12 hours','See Description','Magic users of higher level often summon familiars to assist them with various tasks. Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others’ estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a well-stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary (2d12 hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond. When it arrives, the familiar is a faithful servant and ally to the caster. Normal familiars have 1d3+1 hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lower-than-average human. When the familiar is within 120 ft of the magic user, the magic user gains additional hit points equal to the familiar’s. However, if the familiar is ever killed, the magic user permanently loses twice the familiar’s hit points.\n\nCaster Level\n----------------------------------------------\n  1-2   3-5    6-8    9-11    12-14    15+   Familiar\n01-05 01-05 01-06 01-06 01-07 01-07 Special\n06-25 06-25 07-29 07-29 08-33 08-33 Cat\n26-35 26-36 30-40 30-41 34-45 34-46 Hawk\n36-45 37-47 41-51 42-53 46-57 47-59 Owl\n46-55 48-58 52-62 54-65 58-69 60-72 Raven\n56-65 59-69 63-73 66-77 70-81 73-85 Toad\n66-75 70-80 74-84 78-89 82-93 86-98 Weasel\n76-00 81-00 85-00 90-00 94-00 99-00 None\n\nA special familiar is entitled to a saving throw in order to avoid the effect of the spell.

Cold flame grants the magic user a +2 bonus on any saving throw vs fire damage, also guaranteeing half damage (or no damage against all fire attacks that allow a saving throw for half damage) provided the saving throw is successful. If the magic user fails a saving throw against a cold based attack, however, he or she will suffer twice the normal damage. Hot flame offers the converse of the protections afforded by cold flame. Cold based attacks receive a bonus of +2 on saving throws and guarantee that the caster receives only half damage (or none at all) if his or her saving throw is successful against attacks that would cause full or half damage.'

A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion. Detecting a fire trap is extraordinarily difficult; attempts to find traps are reduced by one-half in efficacy if the trap is a fire trap, and the trap will detonate if an attempt to remove traps fails.'

The fireball detonates with a low roar, causing 1d6 damage per caster level to all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures making successful saving throws suffer only half the indicated damage. When the magic user casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its path the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire volume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area smaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area until the spell’s full volume has been reached. The volume of a 20 ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic ft, and there are 1,000 cubic ft in a 10 × 10 × 10 ft area, so in an area with a 10 ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10 × 10 ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell. The flames do not create any significant change in air pressure, but the furnace-like heat causes all items in the blast to make saving throws against magical fire or ignite (or, in the case of metals, melt).'

Whatever motives drive the caster, he or she may use this spell to transmute roughly 2,000 copper coins (about a cubic foot) per caster level into a metal that closely resembles gold. Anyone viewing this metal has a chance to notice that it is not truly gold. If the result of d20 plus the caster’s level is equal to or less than the observer’s intelligence, the fraud is detected (the GM may pick a representative number for creatures whose exact intelligence is not known, or roll a die). By combining expensive material components with the spell, the caster can make it more likely that the gold will seem true—conversely, there are mundane methods that give a chance to detect this very spell, such as striking the “gold” with cold iron (10% chance of changing the metal back).

The ice is thick enough to walk upon without fear of falling through. The duration of the ice is 1 round/level. The material component for this use is a piece of crystal.\n\nIce ray: a ray of cold lances from the caster’s hand, inflicting 4 hp/caster level against anything in its path. A successful saving throw results in no damage. Even if the ray strikes an object, it continues on the other side until it has extended 10 ft/caster level or is stopped by a thickness of stone of 1 ft or more. The material component for this use is a gem worth 1,000 gp.\n\nShattering globe: the spell forms a globe one inch in diameter, cold but not uncomfortable to the touch. When this sphere is thrown (by hand or sling), it will explode upon impact for 4d6 hit points of damage within a 10 ft radius (half if save vs spells).

The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane—summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and irascible.'

The disease will, of course, create symptoms that the GM will determine; if the geas is resumed, these may or may not remain until the task is completed.

The magic user can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; he or she must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell.

These strands are identical to those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts.\n\nConfusion: Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment/charm effect that will not affect elves or other creatures immune to charm.\n\nLost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall.\n\nIn addition, the magic user can place his or her choice of one of the following five magical effects:\n\n1.

Insights include magical effects (and the corresponding command word) and number of charges (plus or minus 25% of the actual number). The exact bonus (or penalty) of a weapon is not revealed to the player, unless the GM chooses to do so for convenience; the character, of course, would not think of a magic sword as being “+1” or “+3,” just as “enchanted” or “powerfully enchanted,” and the spell reveals information in these terms.

A creature freed from imprisonment appears at the exact spot where the imprisonment took place. When casting the spell’s reverse, if the caster is not specific enough about the imprisoned creature’s identity the spell will normally fail; but there is also a chance it will free the intended creature together with several other imprisoned victims from other places in the ground—some far, some (perhaps) near.

A saving throw for half damage is permitted to every creature in the cloud for each round of exposure to the flames.\n\nIn the first round of the flare, the blazing cloud inflicts one hit point of damage for every two levels of the caster. In the second round of the flare, the heat increases to inflict 1 hit point per caster level, and in the third round of the blaze, damage falls again to one point per two levels.

When the caster seeks to summon the item by means of this spell, he must hold the focus item in his hand and speak the final word of the spell. The focus item will disappear and the summoned item will appear in its place. The summoned item cannot be heavier than 8 lbs or the spell will not function. Moreover, if the item is in the possession (not necessarily in the hand) of another creature, the spell will fail.

The spell’s power is far greater if the item is actually at hand when the spell is cast, for it can then be used as a focus for the gathering of echoes; casting time under these circumstances will be 1d4 turns. If the item (or place) is not at hand, but some detailed information can be woven into the casting of the spell as a focus for the gathering of legend-echoes, the casting time will be 1d10 days. If all that the caster knows about the object or place is rumour, the casting time will be 2d6 weeks. While casting the spell, the caster may not engage in any other activity other than short breaks to eat and sleep.\n\nWhen completed, the spell will reveal the location of any legendary material about the object (or person, or place), and if the spell is cast in the presence of the place, person, or object the spell will invariably gather the legendary lore together into a piece of true information about it. This information, coming as it does from mystical echoes, will take the form of a riddle, rhyme, or other puzzle. In order to cast the spell an item of some value—often a potion—must be used and destroyed in the process.

The spell may be cast upon an unwilling enemy, but in this case the intended target is entitled to a saving throw.

The reverse of the spell, darkness, creates an area of utter darkness just as the light spell creates light, with the only distinction being that the darkness spell has half the duration of a light spell. If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense. The light spell remains stationary if it was not originally cast upon a movable object or creature (in which case the target will bring the illumination with it as it moves).'

The bolt extends in a straight line from the caster beginning, at whatever point along the spell’s range the caster desires, and may extend beyond the spell’s range. The bolt deals 1d6 damage per caster level to all creatures standing in the bolt’s area of effect. Creatures that make successful saving throws suffer half damage. The area of effect may be either a branching, forking maelstrom of electricity 10 ft wide and 40 ft long, or it may be a concentrated blast 5 ft wide and 80 ft long. The length of the bolt itself is not affected by the caster’s level, only the range at which the caster may cause the bolt to originate.\n\nAll items hit by the full force of the bolt must make item saving throws or be destroyed. The force of the bolt is often sufficient to blast doors into smouldering ruin. If the bolt strikes an object that does not conduct electricity, such as a stone wall, it will be deflected backward toward the caster (potentially inflicting a second shock upon those in the target area). Note that the length of a deflected bolt is not increased; the bolt will only rebound for the distance remaining in its original area of effect.'

It cannot bring the dead back to life, grant a level, or permanently change ability scores. In many cases, the GM will be called upon to determine whether the caster’s wish is within the power of a limited wish spell or whether the results of the request will suffer from flaws due to the spell’s limitations. Flaws would include limited durations or partial results. The guidelines set forth above should give the GM some assistance in making such determinations.\n\nIn the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails.\n\nThe guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters.

It is not necessary for the caster to have seen the precise object that the spell will locate: if the caster is familiar with ladders in general, he or she may cast the spell successfully to locate any ladder within the spell’s range. The spell is directional, requiring the magic user to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The magic user may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.)

Despite its name, the spell’s power is not limited to water; it can affect other non-living fluid substances as well, including gases and materials slightly more viscous than water. The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the magic user. For example, a magic user of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 × 70 ft.

The area must be close to the caster, however, for if the caster is more than 30 ft from the area the hound guards, it will return to the spirit realm. The hound can detect virtually any creature that enters the area: it can detect invisibility (which includes creatures on the astral and æthereal planes), can see creatures that are moving between dimensions, and can detect virtually any other method that might be employed to sneak into an area. If any creature larger than a cat or small dog enters the area, the hound will begin baying with its echoing, supernatural bark. Moreover, it will seek to attack intruders from behind (it does not make frontal assaults) and can attack as a monster of 10 HD for 3d6 damage, even if the opponent requires up to a +3 magical weapon to be hit.

The sword attacks as a fighter one-half the magic user’s caster level (and always hits on a natural 19 or 20), and it can hit creatures that can ordinarily be hit only with magic weapons.

To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the targeted creature makes a successful saving throw), the caster’s soul is trapped until it can take over a host or otherwise escape.\n\nThe caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but no more than one per round. The spell’s range applies to two matters; when the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the jar, his or her body must be within the spell’s range of the jar. The range also limits the distance at which the magic user’s soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster’s soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.\n\nThe spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character’s mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user’s mental power is higher.\n\nIf a creature’s soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster’s soul is returned to the magic jar. If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster’s favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster’s favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster’s mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw can only be made once per week.\n\nWhile the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature’s mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while possessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from within the new body.'

For every turn spent casting, the magic user can move a cube of earth 40x40x40 ft.\n\nThe spell is normally used to create walls, moats, etc., but can also be used to move an intact terrain feature from one place to another (although the spell cannot move rock unless the rock is carried within the moved earth).\n\nIf an intact feature (such as a portion of a forest or the foundations under a cottage) is to be moved, an earth elemental must also be summoned.

The spell creates no sound whatsoever. The caster must maintain his or her concentration upon the illusion, or it will evaporate, but while concentrating the caster is able to make the illusion move and respond to events.\n\nThe illusion is dispelled if it is struck with a blow, a falling person, etc. There is no saving throw against the illusion if the observer believes it, and the illusion can actually cause damage to such a deceived victim. A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real. If the observer doubts the reality of the illusion, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to see the illusion for what it really is. If one observer disbelieves the illusion and this disbelief is communicated to others, the others will also gain a saving throw at a bonus of +4.\n\nNote that the spell relies purely on a visual effect; it will have no effect upon a creature that does not see it. Furthermore, the lack of any audible component can make certain illusions completely non-credible. An explosion, for example, is not likely to be believed by anyone if it creates no sound. Various methods may be used by the GM to determine if an NPC or monster believes the effect of a phantasmal force, common sense being the first thing to consider. A player who takes care to craft a believable illusion should be rewarded for skilful use of the spell, not forced into a table of random results.'

Such a transformation can, in rare cases, be fatal. If the spell’s target is successfully transformed, it must make a system shock test against its constitution or die (see, “constitution”). Moreover, there is a base 100% likelihood that the transformed creature will lose its memories and former identity in the change, becoming, for all intents and purposes, the creature into which it was transformed (intelligence cannot be increased by virtue of such a transformation, however).\n\nFor every intelligence point of the transformed creature, the base chance is reduced by 5%, and there is a further +/-5% alteration for each level (or HD) by which the original form’s level (or HD) differs from that of the new form. This check is made on a daily basis, so such a transformation will, eventually, become inevitable according to the laws of chance if the transformed creature is not magically brought back to its original form. A transformed creature retains its former hit points, but otherwise assumes all the physical characteristics of the new form immediately.

The transformation is of an entirely lesser order than that of polymorph other, incurring no risk of a system shock or of truly becoming the transformed creature. Changing from one shape to another requires only 30 seconds, and when the caster returns to his or her original form (ending the spell) he or she will be healed of 1d12 points of any damage inflicted against the polymorphed forms he or she assumed.\n\nThe caster can polymorph into forms no smaller than a songbird and no heavier than 2,000 lbs. Only the movement capabilities of the new form can be used, not its attacks, defences, or other abilities. The magic user can transform him- or herself into a lion, and run as fast as a lion, but his or her claws will do no more damage than a human’s soft fists. Similarly, if he or she transforms into a dragon, he or she will have the dragon’s ability to fly but no breath weapon. As an orc, he or she would be able to use whatever weapons he or she could use in his original shape, but would lack infravision. The caster retains his or her own hit points and armour class.'

The spell may, alternatively, be used to slaughter up to 120 hp of creatures with 10 or fewer hit points each. The total number of hit points is based upon the target’s current hit points, not maximum hit points, so wounded creatures are more vulnerable to the spell.

However, any other creature with fewer than 8 HD within 20 ft of the sphere will be blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colours if it looks at them. The sphere can be destroyed, colour by colour, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first colour must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic sphere, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic cannot dispel the sphere or anything beyond it (unless the first six colours have already been brought down). Magic resistance is effective against a prismatic sphere, but the check must be repeated for each colour present.\n\nEach colour in the sphere has a different effect.

The image must remain visible to the caster or the spell will end. Much like a Mirror Image, the projected image mimics all the caster’s movements, but it is not affected by attacks of any kind. The image possesses an arcane link to the caster; if desired, the magic user can cast spells that originate at the image rather than at the caster, as if the image, rather than the magic user, cast the spell.

The aura is not invulnerable, but it affords considerable protection against evil and summoned creatures, much as a powerful magic circle would. The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extraplanar creatures regardless of alignment.

A small object can be moved at a rate of 10 ft/ round (directly away from the caster), and if the object is a weapon held by a creature, the creature will suffer a penalty to hit equal to the caster’s level. For example, a tenth level magic user could exert so much eldritch force against an attacking orc’s axe that the orc would suffer a –10 to hit with it.

No attack roll is required to hit. If the target fails a saving throw, its strength and the effect of all attacks which are dependent upon strength are reduced by 25%. The amount of reduction is increased by 1%/ caster level (to be rounded off in the case of lower-level magic users simply as a matter of convenience). Thus, if an orc is struck with the ray by a level one magic user, the orc would lose 26% (rounded to 25%, at the option of the GM) of its strength. Its to-hit rolls are not affected, but any damage it inflicts is reduced to 75% (or 74%) of the damage rolled (a good GM avoids minuscule calculations that might bog down the game). A ray of enfeeblement may technically reduce the target’s strength below the required minimum to qualify for a class, but its effects are too temporary to affect class choices (so an enfeebled paladin with a temporary strength of 8 retains his or her paladinhood). Any further effects of the reduced strength are determined by the GM.'

The chest itself must be crafted of the finest materials in order to support the spell’s magic, and it will cost a minimum of 5,000 gp to have a craftsman or craftsmen build it, together with a second, miniature copy. When the magic user casts the spell, one hand upon the chest and one upon the miniature, the chest disappears into the æthereal plane, together with its contents. These contents may be up to one cubic foot of material per caster level (and no more than this) regardless of the chest’s actual volume. If the chest contains any living matter, there is a 75% chance that the spell will completely fail, although if it should succeed, the living creature will be imprisoned in the æthereal plane until freed. The caster (and only the caster) can use the miniature chest to pull the larger one from the æther wherever he or she might be. It is possible, although not likely, that some æthereal creature or æthereal traveller might happen upon the chest while it is in the æthereal plane. So long as the chest remains in the æthereal plane, the magic user will still be able to retrieve it (although it may have been looted). No creature on the material plane has any chance using any magic known to humanity to locate a secret chest that has been hidden in the æthereal plane by means of this spell.

To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature’s name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires 8d6 hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend’s presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created.\n\nWhen the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend’s presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend’s magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain. In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster’s level.\n\nObviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend’s goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.'

During the initial transformation, the creature must make a special system shock roll with a flat 82% chance of success, with a +1 for every point of constitution the creature possesses (100% chance at Con 18). Failing this roll means that the creature dies. The statue does radiate magic slightly and can be detected in this manner as well as with other similar divination spells or items.

Even a victim who has failed a saving throw against the spell will not undertake a course of action that is palpably unreasonable, but the experienced caster can easily phrase his or her requests in such a way as to avoid this problem. No creature will leap off a cliff for no reason; but the caster might need to scout the bottom of a chasm and promise to cast a feather fall spell, or hand the victim a “magical” torch that supposedly permits the power of flight.

Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms contained in table:\n\nFamiliarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a place the caster knows well, either because he or she can currently see it, has been there often, or has used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist, or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such, or has been so completely altered as to no longer be considered “familiar.”\n\nWhen travelling to a false destination, the player rolls 1d20+80 on the table rather than rolling d%, as there is no real destination.\n\nOn Target: The caster appears in the correct location.\n\nOff Target: The caster appears safely, a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\n\nSimilar Area: The caster winds up in an area that is visually or thematically (depending on how the caster identified it while casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance) that this result will indicate that the correct location has been reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, falling 1d% ft unless there is means to arrest the fall. If the party arrives too high and the result would entomb them in a solid surface, they die instantly. Generally, the caster will appear in the closest similar place within range.

Effectively, the caster simply gains the duration of the spell as extra time in which he or she may perform whatever actions he or she wishes, while the rest of the universe is effectively frozen relative to the caster.'

The field’s outside surface is not transparent and is usually a dark amber colour, but anyone inside the sphere can see through to the outside as if the force field did not exist. The spell provides protection against inclement winds and temperature within a certain range, but offers no protection against attacks from outside. Anyone can pass into and out of the hut, and up to 6 medium-sized or 8 small creatures can shelter inside with the caster. If the caster leaves the hut, the spell ends.\n\nInside the hut, the inhabitants will not feel winds of up to 50 mph, which are completely blocked by the bubble of force, but if the wind reaches gale force of 50 mph the tiny hut will be shredded into oblivion. The temperature inside the hut remains at a pleasant 70 ̊ Fahrenheit for so long as the outside temperature remains in a range from 0 ̊ to 100 ̊. For every degree of outside temperature beyond this range, the temperature inside the hut will rise or fall accordingly from 70 ̊.

Once the additional hit points are gone, however, the caster sustains twice normal damage from attacks. The caster’s armour class improves by four points, and he or she attacks as a fighter of the same level. The transformed magic user may only use a dagger as a weapon while in this berserk state, but may attack twice per round, inflicting a +2 bonus on all damage. The magic user cannot cancel the effects of this spell, and will continue to attack until all enemies are killed or the spell duration ends.

Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed).

The wall might be 10 ft high and 200 ft long, or 5 ft high and 400 ft long, or 20 ft high and 100 ft long, etc. The wall need not be cast so that it is attached to anything, and it can even be cast in the air to fall upon opponents, doing 3d10 points of damage in the area where it falls. Breaking through the ice with a melee weapon causes 2 hit points of damage from ice shards per inch of thickness, and can be broken out at a rate of 10 ft per round. Normal fire has no measurable effect upon the wall, but magical fire will melt through it in one round.

The wall itself is one quarter of an inch thick for each level of the magic user and has an area of 20 × 20 ft per caster level.

Any creature in the area must make a saving throw at a penalty of –2. The effect of a successful saving throw depends upon how close the target is to the edge of the area of effect; if the creature is within five ft of the edge of the spell’s area of effect, the creature has jumped free and is not affected by the web. If the creature is not within five ft of the edge and makes its save, that creature will be able to fight its way through the web at twice normal speed (at a rate of 1 ft per turn if its strength is less than 13) and will have no chance of suffocating. No creature within the area of effect, whether a saving throw is made or not, can cast spells or attack. Any creature that fails its saving throw has a cumulative 5% chance of suffocating per turn. Creatures with a strength of less than 13 that fail the saving throw are trapped within the web and cannot move or act at all. Creatures with a strength of 13-17 are capable of moving through 1 ft of webs per turn. A creature with strength 18+ can move through the web at a rate of 10 ft per turn, and creatures such as dragons virtually ignore the webs, breaking through at a rate of 100 ft per turn.

In general, the exact wording of the wish is carried out regardless of its intent, but the GM will not normally be stringent upon this point unless the wish is an attempt to overreach the spell’s power.\n\nIn the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails.\n\nThe guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters.

If the spell is two levels higher than the magic user can cast, there is no bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the spell is more than 2 levels higher than the magic user can cast, each additional level adds a –1 penalty. If the magic user fails this saving throw, the spell is not successfully copied, the caster takes 1d4 points of damage for each level of the spell, and he or she is knocked unconscious for 1 turn per hit point sustained thereby. The damage sustained cannot be healed more quickly than 4 hp per day, even with the assistance of magical healing.

As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the illusionist may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster’s level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds.
