'aerial_servant','Aerial Servant','no','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','10''','1 day/caster level','Special','V,S','9 segments','None','Aerial Servant summons an aerial servant to do his or her bidding. The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth.\n\nWhen fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.'
'animate_dead','Animate Dead','no','Cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','10''','Permanent','Special','V,S,M','1 round','None','Animate Dead calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level. '
'animate_object','Animate Object','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','6','See Description','30''','1 round/caster level','1 cubic ft/caster level','V,S','9 segments','None','Animate Object “brings to life” an inanimate object, allowing it to move and follow the cleric’s simple commands. The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.'
'astral_spell','Astral Spell','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','Touch','Special','Special','V,S','3 turns','None','Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.'
'atonement','Atonement','no','Cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','1 person','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.'
'augury','Augury','no','Cleric','Divination','2','N/A','Caster','Instantaneous','Caster','V,S,M','2 rounds','None','Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to  derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.'
'blade_barrier','Blade Barrier','no','Cleric','Evocation','6','8d8','30''','3 rounds/caster level','Circular path 2-10 ft in radius','V,S','9 segments','None','This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).'
'bless','Bless','yes','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','1','N/A','60''','6 rounds','50 × 50 ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with—5% morale and –1 to hit.\n\nThe spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).'
'chant','Chant','no','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','2','N/A','0','Indefinite (duration of chant)','30 ft radius centred on caster','V,S','1 turn','None','Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.'
'command','Command','no','Cleric','Enchantment/Charm','1','N/A','10''','1 round','1 living creature','V','1 segment','See Description','By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”.\n\nCreatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.'
'commune','Commune','no','Cleric','Divination','5','N/A','Caster','3 rounds (limited number of questions)','See Description','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.'
