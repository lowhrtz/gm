The assassin need not roll to hit for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The percentage chance to kill a victim is 50%, with a bonus of 5% per level of the assassin and a penalty of 5% for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute “hit dice” for “level”). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin’s chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances—guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.'],

Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus to hit of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.'],

Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance). The GM may assign additional penalties and bonuses to this check if the observer is unusually wise or intelligent (or particularly stupid), and common sense, of course, applies at all times.'],

Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators—when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.\nSpectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fi re or fi re based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.\nSpecial Damage: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim’s hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fi ghter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim’s strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.\nIn addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters infl icts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit  point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4 + 38 = 42.\nSpectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120 ft range.

The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth.\n\nWhen fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.'],
        ['animate_dead','Animate Dead','no','Cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','10\'','Permanent','Special','V,S,M','1 round','None','Animate Dead calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level. '],
        ['animate_object','Animate Object','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','6','See Description','30\'','1 round/caster level','1 cubic ft/caster level','V,S','9 segments','None','Animate Object “brings to life” an inanimate object, allowing it to move and follow the cleric’s simple commands. The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.'],
        ['astral_spell','Astral Spell','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','Touch','Special','Special','V,S','3 turns','None','Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.'],
        ['atonement','Atonement','no','Cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','1 person','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.'],
        ['augury','Augury','no','Cleric','Divination','2','N/A','Caster','Instantaneous','Caster','V,S,M','2 rounds','None','Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to  derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.'],
        ['blade_barrier','Blade Barrier','no','Cleric','Evocation','6','8d8','30\'','3 rounds/caster level','Circular path 2-10 ft in radius','V,S','9 segments','None','This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).'],
        ['bless','Bless','yes','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','1','N/A','60\'','6 rounds','50 × 50 ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with—5% morale and –1 to hit.\n\nThe spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).'],
        ['chant','Chant','no','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','2','N/A','0','Indefinite (duration of chant)','30 ft radius centred on caster','V,S','1 turn','None','Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.'],
        ['command','Command','no','Cleric','Enchantment/Charm','1','N/A','10\'','1 round','1 living creature','V','1 segment','See Description','By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”.\n\nCreatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.'],
        ['commune','Commune','no','Cleric','Divination','5','N/A','Caster','3 rounds (limited number of questions)','See Description','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.'],
        ['conjure_animals','Conjure Animals','no','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','30\'','2 rounds/caster level','Conjured creatures','V,S','9 segments','None','A cleric may use this spell to conjure animal allies from thin air and order them into combat. The total hit dice of summoned animals cannot exceed the cleric’s level, and the animals must all be of the same type. This spell will only summon mammals, although giant or prehistoric forms of normal mammals may be conjured if these are present within a few miles of the caster. The GM determines the specifi c type of animal that appears.'],
        ['continual_light','Continual Light','yes','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','120\'','Permanent','60 ft radius globe','V,S','6 segments','See Description','This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost sufficient to rival the light of day. In some respects the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light , but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a light spell, extending 60 ft into the darkness. The reverse of the spell, continual darkness , produces an ink-like darkness in the same 60 ft area and negates the illumination of a continual light spell if one is present.\n\nBy casting the spell upon an enemy’s eyes or other organs of sight, the caster may blind the spell’s subject, causing the same penalties as if the creature were blinded by a light spell. In this instance, a saving throw is permitted, and if it is successful the spell’s effect will centre upon the area immediately behind the targeted creature.'],
        ['control_weather','Control Weather','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','0','4d12 hours','4d4 square miles','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather for several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather.\n\nThis spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.'],
        ['create_food_and_water','Create Food and Water','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','10\'','Instantaneous (permanent)','A day’s ration per caster level','V,S','1 turn','None','Upon completion of the ritual words of this spell, food and/or water will appear from thin air. A caster of fi fth level can conjure up enough food and water to sustain a person or even a horse for fi ve full days. The volume of food and water produced by the spell is approximately one cubic ft per level of the caster.'],
        ['create_water','Create Water','yes','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','1','N/A','10\'','Instantaneous (permanent)','Up to 30 cubic ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water.'],
        ['cure_blindness','Cure Blindness','yes','Cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 round','None (Negate)','This powerful spell allows the cleric permanently to remove virtually all forms of blindness. The reverse of the spell permits a saving throw, and the cleric must successfully touch the spell’s intended target to inflict blindness (permanent duration).'],
        ['cure_critical_wounds','Cure Critical Wounds','yes','Cleric','Necromancy','5','3d8+3','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','8 segments','None (Negate)','This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.'],
        ['cure_disease','Cure Disease','yes','Cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 turn','None (Negate)','By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the affl icted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.'],
        ['cure_light_wounds','Cure Light Wounds','yes','Cleric','Necromancy','1','1d8','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','5 segments','None (Negate)','Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.'],
        ['cure_serious_wounds','Cure Serious Wounds','yes','Cleric','Necromancy','4','2d8+1','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','7 segments','None (Negate)','A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.'],
        ['detect_charm','Detect Charm','yes','Cleric','Divination','2','N/A','30\'','1 turn','See Description','V,S','1 round','None','This spell reveals to the cleric whether a creature is subject to a charm spell. The spell’s magic can discern a charm (or lack thereof) on up to ten creatures. The reverse of the spell conceals the existence of a charm, but affects only one creature.'],
        ['detect_evil','Detect Evil','yes','Cleric','Divination','1','N/A','Caster','1 turn + 5 rounds/caster level','Path 10 ft wide, 120 ft long','V,S,M','1 round','None','This spell allows the cleric to discern emanations of evil (or good, in the case of the spell’s reverse) within the spell’s area of effect, a beam-like pathway. The spell detects evil, not danger, so it will be useless to discover such things as a mindless trap or a poisoned wineglass. Neither will it detect a cursed item unless the nature of the curse is such that the cursed item becomes inherently evil.'],
        ['detect_lie','Detect Lie','yes','Cleric','Divination','4','N/A','30\'','1 round/caster level','One person','V,S,M','7 segments','None','The subject of this spell (not necessarily the caster) gains the ability to discern whether the truth is being told, for the duration of the spell. The reverse of the spell allows the spell recipient’s most brazen falsehoods to seem logical and believable. The spell’s reverse may also be used to ward against the effects of a detect lie spell.'],
        ['detect_magic','Detect Magic','no','Cleric','Divination','1','N/A','Caster','1 turn','Path 10 ft wide, 30 ft long','V,S,M','1 round','None','Detect magic creates a tunnel of magical vision in a path ten ft wide and thirty ft long, in which the cleric sees the aura of any magic item as a glowing blue nimbus. The spell’s effect is blocked by solid wood 3 ft thick, by stone 1 ft thick, and by solid metal 1 inch thick. The cleric can only scan a 60° arc during the course of a round: turning more quickly does not allow magic auras enough time to form in the cleric’s vision.'],
        ['dispel_evil','Dispel Evil','yes','Cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','1 round/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','8 segments','See Description','This spell banishes summoned creatures of evil, or those summoned for evil purposes, to their home planes of existence. Although a saving throw negates the spell’s banishing effect, any creature that would otherwise have been banished will suffer a penalty of –7 to hit the caster for the extent of the spell’s duration.\n\nCreatures affected by this spell include, but are certainly not limited to, afreets, demons, devils, genies (either evil or working toward evil purposes under duress), and elementals summoned for evil purposes. The reverse of the spell has the same effects, but upon summoned creatures of good alignment or those summoned for the purposes of good.'],
        ['dispel_magic','Dispel Magic','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','60\'','Instantaneous','30 ft radius sphere','V,S','6 segments','None','Dispel magic has a base chance of 50% permanently to negate magic—both the magical properties of potions and the ongoing effects of certain spells. All spell effects and relevant items within the stated area of effect are subject to dispelling. Permanent magical items are not disenchanted by the spell, with the exception of potions, which are treated as 12th level for purposes of resolution. However, even a permanently enchanted item must make a saving throw or become non-operational for one round. Any spells in the process of being cast in the spell’s area of effect will be lost, and any ongoing spell effects (such as invisibility ) will be dispelled.\n\nWith respect to each potion, casting, or ongoing spell effect, the base chance of successful dispelling is increased 5% for every level by which the caster’s level exceeds the caster level of the potion, the casting, or the spell effect. The base chance is conversely reduced by 2% per level of difference if the caster is lower level than the caster of the magic to be dispelled. The spell will automatically negate the caster’s own spells if it is used for this purpose or if the caster has previously cast a spell into the same area.'],
        ['divination','Divination','no','Cleric','Divination','4','N/A','Caster','See Description','Caster','V,S,M','1 turn','None','A divination spell gives the caster divine insight about a particular place, examples being a ruined castle, a particular region in a dungeon, or a small vale. The location of the place must be known to the cleric (e.g., the “Red Mausoleum,” if a legendary location, cannot be the focus of the spell, but if the cleric has seen the doorway of the tomb, the spell will be effective). The spell yields rich information compared to an augury , although it may be couched in rather vague and approximate terms.\n\nThe spell reveals the relative power of the creatures in the area, the treasure (“low,” “moderate,” or “rich”), and chances of incurring the wrath of gods or similar beings if the place is disturbed. There is a chance that the cleric will fail to interpret the omens properly; the base chance to succeed in gaining truthful information is 60%, and rises by another 1% per caster level. The chance may also be adjusted by the GM as necessary.\n\nIf the cleric’s reading of the omens is not correct, of course, he or she will be operating on completely false and useless “insights.” The casting of a divination spell is quite dramatic, involving the sacrifice of a dove or other such creature appropriate to the religion in question. Valuable items may also be sacrificed, and such may increase the chance of the cleric receiving clear omens that are easily interpreted.'],
        ['earthquake','Earthquake','no','Cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','120\'','1 round','5 ft diameter/caster level','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The cleric invokes a small but intensely powerful earthquake within this spell’s area of effect. The spell may be used to create landslides, drain marshes, cave in tunnels, and collapse buildings. Yawning cracks in the earth have a good chance to swallow creatures in the area: the chance of falling into such a crevice (by creature size) is 1 in 4 (small), 1 in 6 (medium) and 1 in 8 (large). Being swallowed up in such fashion is, of course, fatal. Trees standing in the area of an earthquake spell have a 1 in 3 chance of being uprooted.'],
        ['exorcise','Exorcise','no','Cleric','Abjuration','4','N/A','10\'','Instantaneous (permanent)','One creature or object','V,S,M','See Description','None','Exorcism is a powerful abjuration that casts out demons, devils, or any supernatural inhabitant or influence from a creature or object that has been possessed or otherwise controlled. Exorcism banishes all charms and enchantments, removes curses, and will cast any possessing demon or other creature back into its nearest physical body other than the one being exorcised. The base chance for the cleric to perform a successful exorcism is randomly determined on a d% if the GM has not previously assigned a specific number to represent the relative difficulty of the exorcism. To the base chance is added a modifier of +1/-1 for each level of difference between the cleric’s caster level and the level or hit dice of the opposing supernatural force (determined by the GM in the case of supernatural forces with no stated level or HD). The cleric begins the exorcism, rolling a d% for each turn. If the cleric’s die roll is equal to or less than the modified chance of success, the exorcism is successful. The process cannot be halted once it has begun, and if the cleric is forced to pause before successfully casting out the supernatural force, the spell will fail.'],
        ['feign_death','Feign Death','no','Cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','Touch','1 turn + 1 round/caster level','One willing creature','V,S,M','2 segments','None','Except as described here, this spell is identical to the third level magic user spell of the same name. The clerical version of the spell is not subject to a limit on the character level it can affect. Note that the spell cannot be cast upon an unwilling subject.'],
        ['find_the_path','Find the Path','yes','Cleric','Divination','6','N/A','Touch','1 turn/caster level','Creature touched','V,S,M','3 rounds','None','This spell imbues one creature with an uncanny sense for the shortest route into or out of a chosen locale. The spell imparts only a visceral intuition of the right direction and shortest distance, so it is impossible to use the spell either to circumvent dangers or to draw a map. This spell may be used to escape from a maze spell (q.v.) in one round and will continue to function thereafter. The spell’s reverse makes a creature unable to make any significant movement beyond aimless wandering.'],
        ['find_traps','Find Traps','no','Cleric','Divination','2','N/A','30\'','3 turns','10 ft wide path','V,S','5 segments','None','This spell permits the cleric to discern the existence of traps, both of magical and mechanical nature.

Its searing flames engulf an area 10 ft in diameter, as set by the caster. Each creature caught within the flames will suffer 6d8 points of damage, halved if the creature makes a successful saving throw.'],
        ['gate','Gate','no','Cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','7','N/A','30\'','See Description','One summoned creature','V,S','5 segments','None','A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and irascible.'],
        ['glyph_of_warding','Glyph of Warding','no','Cleric','Abjuration/Evocation','3','See Description','Touch','Permanent (until discharged)','25 square ft/caster level','V,S,M','See Description','See Description','The glyph of warding is a magically charged sigil or rune, scribed and enchanted to serve as the focal point of a powerful magical trap. The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, floor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defining what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics. The GM must determine what glyphs may be within the capabilities of such formidable individuals.'],

Carried upon a magical wind controlled by the caster, the wind walker(s) may travel as rapidly as 600 ft per turn or as slowly as 60 ft per turn. The caster may carry another person for every 8 caster levels, transforming them into cloudlike wind walkers by his touch. The spell ends when the cleric cancels it or the duration expires.'],

Before the spell can be cast with success, a place in the sanctuary must be inscribed with a rune corresponding to the cleric’s word of recall; any later elimination of this rune by any person other than the cleric will not affect the proper functioning of the spell. Transportation by means of word of recall is instantaneous and not subject to error. The sanctuary may be of any distance from the cleric, and may be above or below ground. The cleric may also transport as much as 25 lbs of other material per level of experience, including equipment or even another living being.'],

The animal to be enchanted must not be completely unintelligent but cannot be of greater than animal intelligence. If the animal fails its saving throw (made at the beginning of the spell’s casting), it will remain docile for the remainder of the casting time. Once the spell is complete, the animal will remain with the druid and can learn tricks similar to those that could be taught to a well-trained domestic pet. Each trick takes a week to learn, and after the animal has been with the druid for three months it will no longer be able to learn new tricks. During this period, if the animal is left alone by the druid for more than three days, the enchantment will be broken and the animal will revert to the wild. A druid may only have animal friends with hit dice totalling twice his or her level. (The total hit dice can thus increase as the druid gains levels.)'],

The spell does not influence the animals’ attitude toward the druid, so it is advisable to ensure ahead of time that they are friendly.
